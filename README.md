## FsPickler

FsPickler is a general-purpose serialization library that focuses on completeness and performance. 
It supports multiple, pluggable serialization formats including Xml, JSON and BSON. 
The library is based on the functional programming concept of 
[pickler combinators](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2243) 
which has been adapted to accommodate the object oriented nature of the .NET framework.
